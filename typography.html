  <h2 class="dm-serif-text-regular">Is It A Font Or A Typeface?</h2>
  <img src="charles taylor.jpeg" alt="a box of letters alphabetized" style="width:50%; height:auto; display:block; margin:20px auto;">

<p class="body-text">
    Let’s talk about the elephant in the room first. Font vs typeface, what’s the difference? Which is correct? The terms typeface and font are sometimes used interchangeably which can be a little confusing. 
  </p>

  <p class="body-text">
    A <strong>typeface</strong> is a collection of fonts while a <strong>font</strong> refers to a specific style or weight within a typeface family. So let’s put this context with an example. Helvetica is a typeface. But Helvetica Bold is a specific font within the Helvetica typeface family. Here’s a visual example so you can see the difference between a typeface and fonts.

  <h2 class="dm-serif-text-regular">What Is Typography?</h2>

  <p class="body-text">
    Now that we understand what a typeface and a font are, what is typography? Typography is the art and technique of arranging type. Whether you’re designing a website, an app, or a poster, you’re using type to deliver a message.
  </p>

  <p class="body-text">
    Typography serves two main purposes. The first is it must be legible. Can a user read and understand it? The second is how you use typography to create a mood or design aesthetic to attract a specific audience.
  </p>

  <p class="body-text">
    Learning the fundamental rules of type, so you can break them later, will help you become a better designer. It just takes practice and a little knowledge. If you want to learn more about type and how it relates to design, check out this article

<h2 class="dm-serif-text-regular">Categories of Type</h2>
	<p>In order to know how to choose fonts, we need to understand the various categories of type, the characteristics of each, and recommended usage. In this guide, we’ll refer to three different categories of type when choosing font pairings.</p>
	<img src="categories of type.jpg"  alt="categories of type. serif vs sans serif vs decorative" style="width:50%; height:auto; display:block; margin:20px auto;">
	
	<h2 class="dm-serif-text-regular">Serif Typefaces</h2>
  <p class="body-text">
    A serif is a small line or stroke attached to the end of a larger stroke, often referred to as the “feet” shown at the bottom of letters. Not all serifs are equal. Some have slight variations depending on the typeface and that is part of what makes them unique. An advantage of using serif typefaces is how many font weights they usually have within a family. One serif family might have a regular, italics, semi bold, semi bold italic, bold, bold italic, small caps, and more.
  </p>
<img src= "this is serif.jpg"  alt="example of serif font" style="width:50%; height:auto; display:block; margin:20px auto;">
  <p class="body-text">
    Serif typefaces are more formal and traditional. They’re often used editorially such as in newspapers, magazines, and the body copy of books. One of the most well-known serif typefaces and probably the first font you ever used on a computer is Times New Roman.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="fade-in">
  <h2 class="dm-serif-text-regular">Sans Serif Typefaces</h2>
	
<img src= "this is sans serif.jpg"  alt="example of sans serif font" style="width:50%; height:auto; display:block; margin:20px auto;">
  <p class="body-text">
    Sans serif typefaces do not have serifs (the French word sans, means “without”). These typefaces are more modern, bold, and great for eye-catching headlines. One of the most popular sans serif typefaces is Arial which is a copycat of Helvetica. Our main brand fonts here at Flux are two san serif typefaces.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="fade-in">
  <h2 class="dm-serif-text-regular">Decorative Typefaces</h2>
<img src= "this is decorative.jpg"  alt="example of decorative font" style="width:50%; height:auto; display:block; margin:20px auto;">
  <p class="body-text">
    This category of typeface should be used sparingly, most for titles and headlines. It can range from scripts to monotype, and anything in between. These are a great way to add character to your design but should be avoided for long paragraphs of body copy as they can be difficult to read.

  <h3 class="dm-serif-text-regular">Tips for Choosing Fonts</h3>

  <p class="intro">
    We’ve discussed what typography is as well as some of the main categories of type — 
    now let’s dive into tips for how to choose the best fonts.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="fade-in">
  <h2 class="dm-serif-text-regular">Start With Inspiration</h2>

  <p class="body-text">
    An important part of the design process is research and inspiration. One of my favorite places to find design inspiration is on Pinterest. Let’s say I’m working on designing a poster to advertise an event. On Pinterest, I searched for “bold poster design” and this is what I found. There’s a lot of fun typefaces that might inspire the next one you use for your design.

<section class="fade-in">
  <h2 class="dm-serif-text-regular">Choose With Your Main Font First</h2>

  <p class="body-text">
      No matter what you are designing, you should have a main font. When it comes to web design, most likely this will be used in your title or headline text. It’s meant to be an accent, to stand out, and influence the mood of your design. It doesn’t really matter what type of font it is, but knowing the first one will help you choose your second.

<section class="fade-in">
  <h2 class="dm-serif-text-regular">Create Contrast With Your Second Font</h2>
  <p class="body-text">
      Now that you have a main font for your design, the best way to choose a good secondary font is to make sure it’s dramatically different yet complements the design. You wouldn’t want to choose two serifs that look similar, there is no contrast and in fact, it looks like a design mistake. Take a look at this example, these are two different serif typefaces but it’s difficult to tell.
  </p>
	<img src= "double serif.jpg"  alt="headline and body both are serif fonts" style="width:50%; height:auto; display:block; margin:20px auto;">

</section>

<section class="fade-in">
  <h2 class="dm-serif-text-regular">Try Pairing Opposites</h2>
  <p class="body-text">
      One of these ways to choose fonts is to choose a pair of opposites. A good example of this is to use a big and bold sans serif for your headline and a nice traditional serif typeface for the body copy. Take a look at this example, to see this tip in action.
  </p>
	
	<img src= "mixed-font.png"  alt="sans serif headline with a serif body font" style="width:50%; height:auto; display:block; margin:20px auto;">

</section>

<section class="fade-in">
  <h2 class="dm-serif-text-regular">Vary Width</h2>
  <p class="body-text">
      Another tip is to think about the width of the typeface and how they complement each other. For example, maybe you want to pair a condensed sans serif typeface with a wider san serif. While they are both the same category of type, they vary in contrast due to their width. Take a look at this example for inspiration.
  </p>
	<img src="condensed sans serif.jpg" alt= "a condensed sans serif typeface with a wider san serif" style="width:50%; height:auto; display:block; margin:20px auto;">
	
</section>
	

  <section class="fade-in">
  <h2 class="dm-serif-text-regular">Consider Shape: Geometric vs. Organic</h2>

  <p class="body-text">
    Typefaces can have geometric or organic attributes in their shape. One of the most well-known geometric typefaces is Futura — notice how open and round the “O” is in this poster design example.
  </p>

	  
	 <figure class="image-with-caption fade-in">
  <img src="geometric.jpeg" alt= "Poster design using the geometric typeface Futura" style="width:50%; height:auto; display:block; margin:20px auto;">  
  <figcaption>Poster design using the geometric typeface Futura.</figcaption>
</figure>
	  
  <p class="body-text">
    In this example, the main headline uses a modern geometric sans serif typeface. This font choice helps establish the rest of the design — it pairs well with the Lomography logotype, the camera product photo, and other design elements.
  </p>
<figure class="image-with-caption fade-in">
  <img src= "lomo instant.png" alt= "Example of a geometric sans serif typeface (source: Dribbble)" style="width:50%; height:auto; display:block; margin:20px auto;">
  <figcaption>Example of a geometric sans serif typeface (source: Dribbble).</figcaption>
</figure>

  <p class="body-text">
    In contrast to the above geometric typeface, notice how organic this typeface pairing is. There’s plenty of variation in the characters — it almost looks a little hand-done. This adds a quirky, expressive quality to the design if that’s what you’re going for.
  </p>
<figure class="image-with-caption fade-in">
 <img src= "quirky.jpeg" alt= "Example of an organic typeface pairing (source: Etsy)" style="width:50%; height:auto; display:block; margin:20px auto;">

</figure>
	  
</section>


<section class="fade-in">
  <h2 class="dm-serif-text-regular">Limit Your Design To 2–3 Typefaces</h2>

  <p class="body-text">
      Just like choosing a color palette, it can be easy to get carried away with all the options available to use for your design. A good general rule is to stick to about 2–3 different typefaces total for a design. Now of course this might vary depending on what you are designing but it’s a good rule of thumb. 
  </p>

  <p class="body-text">
      For example, if you’re designing a logo you’ll most likely modify one main font and maybe use a secondary typeface. For a website or an app, you’ll likely want to follow the same rule. Especially when designing for digital screens, legibility and accessibility are key to creating a good user experience.
  </p>
	<figure class="image-with-caption fade-in">
	<img src="tribeca film.jpeg" alt= "Poster design with 3 typefaces" style="width:50%; height:auto; display:block; margin:20px auto;">
	  <figcaption>Poster design with 3 typefaces (source: Tribeca Film Festival).</figcaption>
</figure>
	
	
  <p class="body-text">
      Take a look at this poster designed for the Tribeca Film Festival. It’s a successful design for many reasons such as using scale with type, a good use of space, and hierarchy. But notice how they limited the design to three typefaces. The “CUT” and “TO” are two distinctly different bold serif typefaces. The first is thick and condensed while the second is still bold but wide. These are further paired well with a third monotype (think, typewriter) font for the main body copy with the fine details of the event. 
  </p>

<section class="fade-in">
  <h2 class="dm-serif-text-regular">Understand The Goal For This Design</h2>

  <q class="pull-quote">
    If you’re designing a brand or a website for a client, ask yourself: are they in an industry where trust is crucial, like banking? Or are they trying to stand out and disrupt their space, like a cryptocurrency app? The answer should shape your font decisions.
  </q>
